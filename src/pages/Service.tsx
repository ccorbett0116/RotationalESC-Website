                        This page is a little different, he wants some text about being pump repair professionals,
                        having a warehouse, and providing repairs/service to many different types of pumps
                        (I think these https://rudikovacko.com/project-type/pumps/) (I'll work on confirming this with him)
                        and then underneath he wants a gallery page consisting of stock photos of people working on pumps
